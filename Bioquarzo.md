# Bioquartz

Bioquartz® is an industrial quartz material, produced by a pyrolytic transformation of common siliceous and feldspar natural sands or even residues of the slabs manufacturing processes.

It is **free from crystalline silica** and thus it is 100% safe.

## Absolutely safe for workers

Bioquartz inner structure is 100% safe for lungs.
No more risk of silicosis!

Operators in the slabs manufacturing plant and in the fabrication plant work in a 100% safe place.

## Local Raw Materials

The minerals used to produce Bioquartz® come from sand, feldspar and limestone deposits available everywhere.

Producing your own Bioquartz® with local raw materials allows the producers to be independent from any far-away supplier, avoiding the risk of running out of raw materials.

You could therefore produce Bioquartz in Australia with 100% australian raw materials!
