# Bioquartz

Bioquartz® is an industrial quartz material, produced by a pyrolytic
transformation of common siliceous and feldspar natural sands or even residues
of the slabs manufacturing processes.

It is **free from crystalline silica** and thus it is 100% safe.

## Absolutely safe for workers

Bioquartz inner structure is 100% safe for lungs. No more risk of silicosis!

Operators in the slabs manufacturing plant and in the fabrication plant work in
a 100% safe place.

## Hi-Tech Material

Bioquartz is an hi-tech raw material and, therefore, it is always and
**consistently of first quality**.

Mechanical, physical and aesthetical features of the finished product made with
Bioquartz® or natural quartz are almost the same and therefore perfectly
suitable for the same applications.

## Local Raw Materials

The minerals used to produce Bioquartz® come from sand, feldspar and limestone
deposits available everywhere.

Producing your own Bioquartz® with local raw materials allows the producers to
be independent from any far-away supplier, avoiding the risk of running out of
raw materials.

You could therefore produce Bioquartz in Australia with 100% australian raw
materials!

## Waste Zero

All the production wastes of Bretonstone® slabs plant – sludges and residual
mixtures – could be used again as raw materials in your Bioquartz® production
plant .
